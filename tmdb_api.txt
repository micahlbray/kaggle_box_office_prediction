Request Rate Limiting:
Our current limits are 40 requests every 10 seconds and are limited by IP address, not API key.
The timer will reset 10 seconds from your first request within the current 10 second "bucket".
This means that if you trigger the limit you will have to wait up to 9 seconds before the timer resets but depending where you are within the 10 second window,
it could be the very next second.
